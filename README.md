# GPIBUtils
These are really now more just a set of classes to enable automation of HP gear.

For the utils you can jump over to https://github.com/TGoodhew/GPIBUtils-Old

The class library HPDevices contains the individual classes that provide functionality for individual devices.

HPTestApps contains the test apps for both the classes themselves.
